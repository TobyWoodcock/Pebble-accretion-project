MPhys project to investigate the formation of planets in protoplanetary discs as a result of pebble and gas accretion. Pebble accretion is a mechanism by which a protoplanets gains solid material through the accretion of centimetre-scale 'pebbles'. Gas accretion, on the other hand, is the development of a gaseous envelope around a sufficiently massive protoplanet. 

To model the formation of a planet through pebble and gas accretion, we use [Python](https://www.python.org). We make use of [`pebble-predictor`](https://github.com/astrojoanna/pebble-predictor.git) by [Dr. Joanna Drążkowska](https://www2.mps.mpg.de/homes/drazkowska/Home.html) to predict the populations of pebbles and their sizes in the protoplanetary disc and [`epsilon.tar.gz`](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/c.w.ormel/software.html) by [Chris Ormel](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/c.w.ormel/index.html) and [Beibei Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/beibei-liu/) to estimate the efficiency of Pebble accretion onto a protoplanet.
